# backrest_windows-service
Backrest as a Windows Service is an adaptation of project https://github.com/garethgeorge/backrest<br/>
It provide a way to run Backrest as a windows service under system account, thus you don't care about uptime and permissions<br/>
I also provide a 32bits build that is not provided on original project<br/>
Simply download the project as a ZIP file and unzip it, than launch as admin the file "install_as_a_service.bat"<br/>
Your web browser should open to the Backrest WebUI on http://127.0.0.1:9898<br/>
